Q: Why are we doing this? 
A: This repository is designed for QA's Software Development Bootcamp to create a project where we can use all the skills we have learnt. 

Q: How I expected the challenge to go?
A: To be honest, at first I found it slightly difficult, however as I started to pick up the pace, it got easier and I was able to wrap my head around all the topics easier.

Q: Possible improvements for future versions of the project?
A: I could improve this project in the future by connecting this to-do list to an SQL database and connecting the database to a cloud service.
